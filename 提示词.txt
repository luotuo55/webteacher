Make this app fully responsive and touch-friendly for elementary school students using iPads, Chromebooks (with touch screens), and mobile phones. 
- Use larger touch targets (buttons and draggable elements at least 48x48 pixels).
- Optimize drag-and-drop interactions for touch events (no hover dependency).
- Ensure the layout adapts perfectly: full-screen on tablets, stacked vertically on phones, and keyboard/mouse fallback on laptops.
- Use Tailwind CSS responsive classes (sm:, md:, lg:) for breakpoints.
- Add meta viewport tag if missing.
- Test for smooth performance on low-end devices.
Update the code accordingly and keep the Make-a-Ten interactive features intact.
